**Movie Rater** is a Code Platoon final project created by Huralain Mohamed. The frontend uses React, Font Awesome React Components, and custom CSS styling. Users can view each movie description and rating from a list of popular movies from the database, as well as make their own rating of the movie.

**Movie Rater** utilizes the [The Movie Database API 3](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction). The Movie Database (TMDb) is a popular, user editable database for movies and TV shows.
